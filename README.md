## Summary
Using a dataset of over 100k real world orders provided by Olist,
the largest department store in Brazilian market places, the code
provided in Jupyter Notebooks constructs a product recommendation

This engine can take a user's unique id and a minimum similarity 
score and return product ids the user has not purchased yet, ranked
by similarity to the user.
